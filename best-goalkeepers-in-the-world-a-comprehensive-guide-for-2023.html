How do they compare to each other and the legends of the past?</p><p>In this article, we will try to answer these questions and more, using various criteria such as statistics, awards, achievements, and reputation.</p><p>We will also look at some of the upcoming talents and the best goalkeepers in different competitions such as the World Cup and FIFA Mobile. Let’s get started!</p><h2><span id=World_Best_Goalkeeper_2024>World Best Goalkeeper 2024</span></h2><p>The year 2024 is still a few months away, but we can already make some predictions based on the current form and performance of the top goalkeepers in the world.</p><p>Of course, things can change quickly in soccer, and injuries, transfers, and loss of form can affect the rankings.</p><p>However, based on the available data and expert opinions, we can narrow down the list of candidates to a few names.</p><p>Here are some of the factors that we considered:</p><ul><li>Club and international performance in the 2023-24 season</li><li>Individual awards and recognition</li><li>Consistency and reliability</li><li>Leadership and influence</li><li>Potential and improvement</li></ul><p>Based on these criteria, we have selected five goalkeepers who we think are the best in the world right now, or at least very close to it.</p><p>Here they are:</p><h3><span id=1_Thibaut_Courtois_Real_Madrid_and_Belgium><strong>1. Thibaut Courtois (Real Madrid and Belgium</strong>)</span></h3><p>The Belgian giant has been one of the most consistent and reliable goalkeepers in the world for several years.</p><p>He has won multiple trophies with Real Madrid, including two<a href=#> La Liga</a> titles and a <a href=#>Champions League</a> title.</p><p>He was also instrumental in Belgium’s run to the semi-finals of the 2022 World Cup, where he won the <a href=#>Golden Glove</a> award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament.</p><p>Thibaut has excellent reflexes, positioning, handling, and distribution skills.</p><p>He is also a leader on and off the pitch, commanding his defence and organizing his team.</p><h3><span id=2_Ederson_Moraes_Manchester_City_and_Brazil>2. Ederson Moraes (Manchester City and Brazil)</span></h3><p>The Brazilian shot-stopper is one of the key players in Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City team, which has dominated English soccer in recent years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ederson.jpg><p>He has won three <a href=#>Premier League</a> titles, four League Cups, one FA Cup, and one Champions League title with City.</p><p>Ederson is also Brazil’s number-one goalkeeper, having helped them win the Copa America in 2021.</p><p>He is known for his exceptional ability to play with his feet, launching accurate long passes and initiating attacks from the back.</p><p>He is also very agile, brave, and composed under pressure.</p><h3><span id=3_Andre_Onana_Manchester_United_and_Cameroon>3. André Onana (Manchester United and Cameroon)</span></h3><p>The Cameroonian keeper has been one of the most impressive performers in Europe since joining Manchester United from Ajax in 2023.</p><p>He has quickly established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League, helping United challenge for the title and reach the final of the Champions League.</p><p>He is also a hero for his country, having led them to their sixth Africa Cup of Nations title in 2022.</p><p>Onana is a very athletic and acrobatic goalkeeper, capable of making spectacular saves and reactions.</p><p>He is also very confident and calm with the ball at his feet, playing out from the back with ease.</p><h3><span id=4_Marc-Andre_ter_Stegen_Barcelona_and_Germany>4. Marc-André ter Stegen (Barcelona and Germany)</span></h3><p>The German keeper has been one of the few bright spots for Barcelona in recent years, as they have struggled to keep up with their rivals domestically and internationally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/st.jpg><p>He has been a loyal servant for the Catalan club, winning four La Liga titles, four Copa del Rey titles, one Champions League title, and two FIFA Club World Cup titles.</p><p>He is also Germany’s first-choice goalkeeper, having replaced Manuel Neuer after his decline.</p><p>Stegen is a very complete goalkeeper, with no obvious weaknesses in his game.</p><p>He is very good at shot-stopping, handling, positioning, distribution, communication, and decision-making.</p><h3><span id=5_Gianluigi_Donnarumma_Paris_Saint-Germain_and_Italy>5.
